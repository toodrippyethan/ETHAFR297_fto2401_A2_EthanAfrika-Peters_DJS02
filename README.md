## PLEASE NOTE:

This exercise provides user stories in [the Gherkin syntax](https://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html), covered in Documentation - Reading Material<!--Link to Module 2 Lesson 4 on Documentation-->. Please make sure you understand the use and meaning of this syntax before continuing.

 

Below is the HTML and JavaScript code for a “Whole Number Divider”. At the moment it only meets two user stories (see below under “Resolved Stories”). Please ensure that it meets all user stories listed below:

 
### Resolved Stories
### Scenario: Starting program state

- GIVEN that the submit button has not been pressed yet
- AND the code has just loaded
- THEN “NO calculation performed” should be displayed at the bottom

### Scenario: Dividing numbers result in a whole number

- GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
- WHEN 20 is entered into the first input
- AND 10 is entered into the second input
- THEN 2 should be displayed at the bottom
 
### Unresolved Stories
### Scenario: Dividing numbers result in a decimal number

- GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
- WHEN 20 is entered into the first input
- AND 3 is entered into the second input
- THEN the number 6 with no decimal should be shown
 

### Scenario: Validation when values are missing

- GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
- WHEN either or both inputs are empty
- THEN the divisions should not be done
- AND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Both values are required in inputs. Try again”.
 

### Scenario: An invalid division should log an error in the console

- GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
- WHEN 20 is entered into the first input
- AND 0 is entered into the second input
- THEN the division should not be done
- AND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Invalid number provided. Try again”.
- AND an error should be logged in the browser console that shows the call stack
- BUT the program should not crash entirely
 

### Scenario: Providing anything that is not a number should crash the program

- GIVEN that the submit button is pressed
- WHEN ‘YOLO’ is entered into the first input
- AND ‘+++’ is entered into the second input
- THEN the entire screen should be replaced with “Something critical went wrong. Please reload the page
- AND an error should be logged in the browser console that shows the call stack.
